## About Me

Hello! I'm Kevin, a passionate data engineer and cloud enthusiast with a strong background in SQL and AWS services. My expertise lies in designing and managing databases, as well as leveraging cloud infrastructure to build scalable and efficient solutions.

### SQL DDL/DML

I have extensive experience with SQL, particularly in the areas of Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). My skills include:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
  - Creating, altering, and dropping database objects such as users, tables, indexes and views.
  - Defining and managing constraints to ensure data integrity.
  - Designing normalized database schemas for optimal performance and maintainability.

- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
  - Writing queries to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.
  - Utilizing joins, subqueries, and set operations to manipulate data across multiple tables.
  - Implementing stored procedures, triggers, and functions to automate and streamline data operations.

### AWS EC2 and S3

In addition to my SQL expertise, I am proficient in using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to deploy and manage cloud-based solutions. My experience includes:

- **AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
  - Launching and configuring EC2 instances to host applications and databases.
  - Implementing security best practices, including the use of security groups and key pairs.
  - Automating instance management with scripts and AWS CLI.

- **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
  - Setting up and managing S3 buckets for scalable and durable object storage.
  - Implementing lifecycle policies to optimize storage costs.
  - Securing data with bucket policies, IAM roles, and encryption.
